##Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

* 2 1/4 tsp. ground ginger
* 1 tsp. salt

* 1 egg at room temperature
* 1 cup natural applesauce
* 1 tsp. baking soda

for the frosting:
* 1 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract or vanilla paste
* 1/2 tsp. orange extract or 1/8 tsp. orange oil (I used Boyajian Pure Citrus Orange Oil)

Create the Gingerbread Loaf and Frosting:

create the loaf:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease and flour a 9"x5" bread pan or use baking spray.  You can also use two pieces of decorative 7"x2.5" disposable bakeware, as pictured.  These do not have to be greased or sprayed.  Set them on a small cookie sheet to bake, and turn them around half way through the baking cycle.  These are perfect for gift giving!

In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and salt.  Set aside.

In the large bowl of a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar until fluffy.  Stir in orange extract.  Add egg, and mix well.

Mix the baking soda into the applesauce.   Stir into creamed butter mixture.  Add the flour mixture and mix until smooth.

Scoop the batter into prepared loaf pan(s).

Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean.  If baking the 2 smaller loaves, bake for 30 to 40 minutes.

create the frosting:
Beat the cream cheese until fluffy.  Add vanilla and orange extract.  Slowly beat in confectioner's sugar.

Once the cake has cooled, evenly spread the frosting on top.  Garnish with chopped candied ginger or orange peel, if desired.

Once frosting has set, loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  I feel it tastes so much better chilled, but this is not necessary if eating the up the same day.
