I love brownies, fairly quick and incredibly tasty. Here's my prefered recipe, shamelessly stolen from a colleague.

## Ingredients
- 4oz Butter
- 1.5oz Cocoa
- 2 Eggs
- 8oz Castor Sugar (usually reduce this slightly)
- 2oz Self-raising Flour
- 1pk Choc Chips

## Steps 
1. Melt butter, add cocoa
2. In separate bowl beat eggs with sugar for long time until thick
3. Add cocoa/butter mix to sugar and eggs
4. Add flour and choc chips
5. Cook @ 160C for 1/2 hour

This should make about enough for an 8- or 9-inch baking tin.

Simples takes about an hour from start to finish and taste awesome, probably best not to eat too many though.
