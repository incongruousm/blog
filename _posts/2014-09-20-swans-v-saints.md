Decent result in the end for #saintsfc today. Poor in the first half and Bony's foolhardy sending off both helped and hindered. Saints had the better of the second half but with Swansea barely venturing out of their half it was tough to break them down even with a man up. In the end a goal was inevitable but Saints were sluggish and wasteful throughout. Roll on QPR!
