A couple of months back I finished reading [Peter F Hamilton's](http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/) excellent [_Nights Dawn Trilogy_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night's_Dawn_Trilogy) and was looking for something new to move onto. I'd seen plenty of recommendations for [_The Name of the Wind_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind) from [Patrick Rothfuss](http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/) so I dived in.

Wow. Unfortunately the world still awaits the third and final(?) book in this series and it can't come soon enough. In Kvothe, Rothfuss has created a character I find thoroughly fascinating. His story unfolds non-chronologically slowly teasing out a fantastical past with hints at the present that left me unable to put it down. Thoroughly recommended!
